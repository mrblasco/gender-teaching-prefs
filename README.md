**"How Gender Preferences Shape Teaching? Insights from Five Million Syllabi on Collaboration, Interdisciplinarity, and Reading Selections."**

This study investigates how academics' preferences for solo teaching or co-teaching are shaped by gender and how these preferences influence key teaching characteristics. Using a unique dataset of over five million syllabi, we analyze:

- Team formation and gender homophily in co-teaching
- The relationship between team gender composition and interdisciplinarity
- Novelty and breadth of course materials
- Gender representation in cited authors

Our findings highlight the structural patterns behind gendered teaching practices in higher education and offer evidence-based insights into improving diversity and collaboration in academia.
