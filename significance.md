## Significance Statement

Despite growing gender diversity in academia, we reveal a persistent underrepresentation of mixed-gender teaching teams across universities. By analysing 5M syllabi (1999-2019), we find that instructors tend to collaborate with same-gender colleagues at a rate more than twice the expected rate. This is not fully explained by institutional or disciplinary constraints, suggesting a gender-based bias. Moreover, mixed-gender teams tend to design more interdisciplinary courses and assign more gender-diverse readings, whereas women tend to assign more novel readings. These findings extend the literature on gender bias in academia into the domain of teaching, revealing how collaboration dynamics influence the pedagogical content and the student experience. Understanding these patterns can inform policies aimed at improving equity and pedagogical quality in higher education.
