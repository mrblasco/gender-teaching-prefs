## Data

We obtained a corpus of over six million documents compiled by Open Syllabus (New York, US). Open Syllabus created this dataset through web extractions that identified syllabi from university websites, with a median confidence level of 99.8%. A tagging algorithm extracted key course details, such as the title, field, description, academic year, duration, and language, a list of anonymised instructors, and the assigned readings.^[The documentation available at: https://docs.opensyllabus.org] While the original dataset included syllabi in 49 languages, most documents (96%) were in English. For simplicity, we focused exclusively on these documents.^[Our focus on English-language courses means that, while we have comprehensive data for English-speaking countries such as Canada, Ireland, the United States, and Great Britain, the sample in non-English-speaking countries tends to be more representative of internationally oriented universities. These are typically institutions offering programs in English or advanced-level courses, such as postgraduate programs or disciplines where English is the primary medium of instruction within traditional universities.]

The resulting dataset comprised 5.4 million syllabi from approximately 4,000 higher education institutions across fifteen countries (see Table \@ref(tab:SI-country) for the list of countries) from 1990 to 2019, with a higher proportion of syllabi in recent years (see Table \@ref(tab:SI-years)). OpenSyllabus classified these syllabi into 69 top-level fields derived from the U.S. Department of Education's CIP code classification (see Table \@ref(tab:SI-fields)).^[The original CIP classification is available online: https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/browse.aspx?y=55] About 2.9 million syllabi (53% of the total) listed readings matched with bibliographic sources, providing additional metadata about authorship information, journal, and publication year. The institution was matched to a list of more than 22,000 entities from the Research Organisation Registry, providing further metadata, including the institution's country and enrollment figures --- the institutions in our sample account for over 35 million enrolled students today.^[For more details on how OpenSyllabus classified and matched the data, the related documentation is available online at https://docs.opensyllabus.org.]

Each syllabus lists one or more instructors, with 76% listing a single instructor, 16% listing two, 4% listing three, and 4% listing more than three instructors. OpenSyllabus determined the instructors gender automatically based on their names, resulting in 52% male, 37% female, and 11% unknown categories. (Table \@ref(tab:SI-composition) illustrates the gender composition of the teaching teams). After excluding syllabi with unknown gender, the distribution was 58% male and 42% female instructors, which aligns closely with the 45% of female academic staff reported in OECD countries [@oecd2022]. Open Syllabus used the same method to determine the gender of the authors listed in the readings, resulting in 32% female and 56% male authors, with 12% of the authors having an unknown gender.

## Outcome variables 

Building on prior research highlighting the value of teaching cutting-edge knowledge [@biasi2022education], the role of interdisciplinary training in shaping career outcomes [@han2023interdisciplinary], and evidence of gender disparities in citation practices---particularly the under-recognition of female scholars and the influence of the citing author's gender [@aksnes2011female; @chatterjee2021gender; @tekles2022same]--- we defined key outcome variables to examine how team configurations, including gender composition and team size, are associated with the interdisciplinarity of assigned readings and their key characteristics, such as publication age and the inclusion of female-authored works. The outcome variables are described in detail below; a concise summary is provided in Table \@ref(tab:outcome-variables).

### Interdisciplinarity

We measured interdisciplinarity by analysing course descriptions from syllabi, following Evans et al. [@evans2016measuring; @han2023interdisciplinary]. This approach converts course descriptions into "bags of words", where word frequencies are normalised by the inverse ratio of term frequency to document frequency (TF-IDF). We then computed a correlation matrix of word usage across academic fields to quantify the conceptual distances between them. The interdisciplinarity score for each syllabus was calculated as a weighted average of pairwise correlations with other syllabi, with weights reflecting field distance (see Supporting Information, Section \@ref(si-interdisciplinarity)). This method ensures that syllabi associated with distant fields, either academically or conceptually, are considered more interdisciplinary.^[To scale to millions of documents, we used random subsampling of academic fields over years and averaged results across subsamples for robustness (see Supporting Information, Section \@ref(si-interdisciplinarity)).]

We expressed interdisciplinarity for each syllabus $i$ as the percentile rank within each academic year of the interdisciplinarity score:
$$
  \text{Interdisciplinarity}_i = \text{PR}_{yr} (\text{Interdisciplinarity Score}_i),
$$
Where $\text{PR}_{yr}$ represents the percentile rank function applied to all syllabi within a given year $yr$. This normalisation controls for skewed score distributions and allows comparison across years.

### Readings Selection

To characterise the assigned readings, we calculated two key dimensions: the age of the readings and the proportion of female authors represented. First, we define the total number of references, $N_i$, as the sum of articles, books, and chapters listed in a syllabus $i$. This variable serves as a broad measure of a course's "breadth," as more assigned readings may indicate a more extensive or comprehensive curriculum. Then, we define the _Age of Readings_ variable as the difference between the syllabus year ($\text{Year}_i$) and the average publication year of the assigned readings $k=1,\cdots,K$:  
$$
  \text{Age of Readings}_i = \text{PR}_{yr}\left(\text{Year}_i - \sum_{k=1}^{N_i} \text{Publication Year}_k / N_i\right),
$$
Where $\text{PR}_{yr}$ represents the percentile rank function applied to all syllabi within a given year $yr$. This variable provides a proxy of how recent, or "novel," the readings are. While more sophisticated methods to measure novelty are available [@uzzi2013atypical; @wang2017bias], we employ this more straightforward approach because pedagogical innovation tends to be incremental, and computationally intensive methods are impractical for large-scale datasets like ours. We anticipate that novelty will vary across fields (e.g., history courses may cite older texts more frequently than computer science courses). Still, within-field differences in novelty serve as a proxy for how close a course is to the current frontier of knowledge ("novelty").

Finally, we define the _Ratio of Female Authors_ as the proportion of female authors among all authors in the assigned readings: 
$$
  \text{Ratio of Female Authors}_i = \frac{\text{Female Authors}_i + 1} {\text{Female Authors}_i + \text{Male Authors}_i + 2}.
$$
Here, we add two pseudo-observations (one for each gender) to stabilise the ratio, preventing extreme values in cases with very few authors [@agresti2000simple]. This metric enables us to examine whether gender and collaboration are associated with the representation of female-authored work in teaching.

## Simulating Teaching Collaborations

Building on previous research showing that gender-diverse teams are underrepresented in science [@guimera2005team], we investigate the evolution of the gender composition of co-teaching teams to determine whether it deviates from what is expected under a gender-neutral matching process. Crucially, this analysis accounts for the fact that team formation is influenced not only by individual preferences but also by institutional factors, such as departmental affiliation or academic field, as co-teaching typically occurs among faculty within the same department or the same academic field. To account for these institutional constraints, we employ a Monte Carlo randomisation approach adapted from Uzzi et al. [@guimera2005team;@uzzi2013atypical]. This approach preserves the overall gender composition and team size distribution while randomly reassigning instructors within strata defined by institution, field, and academic year. This simulation generates a randomised network in which instructors form teams independently of gender while maintaining the underlying institutional and disciplinary constraints. Therefore, by comparing actual data against teams formed in the randomised network, we can assess the difference between the observed team gender composition in the data and a counterfactual situation where instructors formed teams in a gender-neutral manner. See the details in the Supplementary Information (Section \@ref(si-simulations)).

## Regression analysis

To evaluate the association between gender composition, team size, and course content, we define four teaching team configurations, $j\in \{F, M, MM, MF/FM, FF\}$, where F and M denote female and male instructors teaching alone, respectively. MM represents two male instructors; FM/MF indicates mixed-gender pairs; and FF corresponds to two female instructors. We then employ regression analysis to study the association between these team configurations and course outcomes across academic years, $t = 1999, \cdots, 2020$. As discussed before, the outcomes of interest include (1) interdisciplinarity, (2) the average age of readings, and (3) the proportion of cited female authors. To estimate these effects, we employ the following linear mixed-effects model:
\[
Y_{j, t} = 
 \alpha_t + 
 \text{Team}_{j, t} + 
 \text{STEM}_t + \eta_{f,t} +  % fields
 \text{Country}_{t} + \text{Enroll}_t + \delta_{t} + 
 \epsilon_{j, t}.
\]
Where: 

- $Y_{j, t, f, c, s}$ is the outcome variable for team configuration $j$ in year $t$, field $f$, and school $s$,

- $\alpha_t$ is a fixed effect for the academic year $t$,

- $\text{Team}_{j, t}$ is a fixed effect for team configuration $j$ in year $t$,

- $STEM_t$ is a fixed effect for STEM courses in year $t$,

- $\eta_{f,t}$ is a random intercept for academic field $f = 1,\cdots, 69$ at year $t$,

- $\text{Country}_{c, t}$ is fixed effects for the institution $s$'s country $c$ in year $t$,

- $\text{Enroll}_{t}$ is an effect for the institution's enrollment size at year $t$,

- $\delta_{s, t}$ is a random intercept for each of approximately 4000 unique institutions,

- $\epsilon_{j,t}$ is the residual error term.

Together, the model allows us to examine the association between teaching team configurations and citation-related course outcomes while accounting for potential confounding factors across disciplines and institutions.
