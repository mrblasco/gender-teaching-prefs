As illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:gender-year), the share of classes taught by a single female instructor steadly increased between 2000 and 2019, going from 25% to 36% courses per year (a 44% increase). Similarly, the share of courses co-taught by two female instructors rose by 33% over the same period, going from 3% to 4%.  In contrast, the share of mixed-gender teams remained largely unchanged at 3% per year. This overall trend aligns with the increase in women holding academic positions worldwide.[^women-academia] However, the lack of growth in mixed-gender teams suggests the growing presence of women in academia has not translated into increased mixed-gender collaborations. Notice that, although co-teaching teams make up only 13% of courses in 2019, this still amounts to over 660,000 courses --- underscoring their significance in academic teaching.

[^women-academia]: In 2000, women constituted approximately 35% of academic staff worldwide. By 2022, this figure had risen to about 44%, according to data from the World Bank; The data are available at: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.TER.TCHR.FE.ZS

```{r montecarlo, fig.cap = "Comparison of gender composition between actual courses and courses simulated under gender neutrality with Monte Carlo, while keeping constant the institutional constraints (i.e., number of teams by size, institution, academic year, and 69 academic fields). Simulated mixed-gender teams consistently exceed observed proportions, highlighting persistent barriers to forming gender-diverse teaching teams.", out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}

```

To assess whether gender preferences influence co-teaching teams, Figure \@ref(fig:montecarlo) compares the actual gender composition of courses with a distribution generated by a Monte Carlo simulation. This simulation assumes no gender preferences in team formation, while it preserves institutional constrants by holding constant the number of teams by size, institution, year, and across 69 academic fields.

The results reveal that simulated mixed-gender courses consistently exceed those observed in the actual data, nearly doubling them each year from 2005 to 2019. For instance, in 2019, the simulated proportion of mixed-gender collaborations was 6% compared to just 3% in the actual data (a difference of 150,000 courses). This suggests that even when accounting for constraints like available instructors at each institution in a given field and academic year, there is a persistent tendency to form same-gender teams beyond what would be expected under gender-neutral team formation.

```{r montecarlo-list-first, fig.cap = "This figure illustrates the ratios between the gender composition generated by Monte Carlo simulation under gender-neutral preferences and the observed distribution for mixed-gender courses based on whether the first-listed instructor on the syllabus is a woman ('fm') rather than a men ('mf'),  by academic year. A value greater than one means the proportion of teams under gender-neutral team formation exceeds the actual teams.", out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}

```

Figure \@ref(fig:montecarlo-list-first) revisits the gap in mixed-gender courses by distinguishing between courses where the first-listed instructor on the syllabus is a woman ("fm") versus a man ("mf"). The results reveal that the ratio of expected to actual mixed-gender courses is slighty greater for female-lead courses than male-lead ones. If the first-listed instructors tend to be more senior or hold a higher rank, this finding suggests that differences in hierarchical position or seniority could also contribute to the gap in mixed-gender courses, though they do not fully account for it.

```

To examine field-specific patterns, Figure \@ref(fig:formation-by-field) compares the simulated and observed gender composition of courses, disaggregated by academic field. The results are remarkably consistent across fields, with mixed-gender courses being one to four times more common in the simulated data than in the observed data. The results reveal that the gap between simulated versus observed mixed-gender teams is largest in courses within Business, Administration and Law and lowest in Engineering, Manufacturing and Construction (Figure \@ref(fig:formation-by-field-aggregated)). This finding suggests that field-specific dynamics may exacerbate or moderate the low presence of mixed-gender courses. These dynamics may be influenced by cultural factors, institutional barriers, or the varying presence of women across academic fields---factors that fall outside the focus of this paper.

## The Impact on Course Materials

To assess the impact of teaching team size and gender composition on course materials, we analysed their relationship with four key metrics: the percentile rank of the interdisciplinarity score per year ("interdisciplinarity"), the average publication year of the readings ("age of readings"), the share of female authors cited in the readings ("share of female authors"), and the total number of readings included ("course breadth"). We used multiple linear regressions to account for differences across academic fields, institutions, years, and other relevant controls.

### Interdisciplinarity

```{r interdisciplinarity, fig.cap = "The figure illustrates the differences in interdisciplinarity between female-only (the baseline, set to zero), male-only, and mixed-gender courses. Although female-only courses exhibit slightly less interdisciplinarity than male-only courses (both individually and in teams), mixed-gender courses exhibt the highest levels of interdisciplinarity. These differences are obtained from separate linear regressions for each year and team size, controlling for country and academic field. Interdisciplinarity is measured in percentile ranks per year of the interdisciplinary score, with higher values indicating greater interdisciplinarity scores relative to other courses in the same cohort.", out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/interdisciplinarity.pdf")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:interdisciplinarity) shows that, while female-only courses exhibit slightly less interdisciplinarity than male-only courses (individually and in teams), mixed-gender courses exhibit the highest levels of interdisciplinarity. Between 2000 and 2019, mixed-gender courses scored approximately 5% higher than male-only or female-only courses with similar characteristics. These findings suggest that, although minor gender-based differences in interdisciplinarity exist between female-only and male-only courses, gender diversity appears to have the most significant impact on fostering interdisciplinarity.

Disaggregating the analysis by academic field, with separate regressions by field accounting for year and country controls, shows that the impact of gender diversity is not homogeneous across fields (Figure \@ref(fig:interdisciplinarity-by-field)). Specifically, it appears to have a larger effect in specific fields, especially in Arts and Humanities (between 10%  in 2005 and 5% in 2019) and Social Sciences, Journalism and Information (between 8% and 4% during the same period).

### Citing Women Authors

```{r female-authors, fig.cap = "The figure illustrates the differences in the percentage of female authors cited in course readings between female-only (the baseline, set to zero), male-only, and mixed-gender courses. Male-only courses cite approximately 4% fewer female authors than female-only courses. While mixed-gender courses mitigate this effect to some extent, they do not reduced it by half, as one might expect if reading selections were equally influenced by both male and female instructors in a two-person team. This suggests that male instructors preferences continue to influence reading selections, even in mixed-gender courses. However, mixed-gender courses show a rising percentage of female authors in more recent years. These differences are represented as regression coefficients from separate linear regressions, controlling for total number of authors, academic year, team size, country, and academic field. Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals. The proportion of cited women is measured by adding two pseudo-observations to both male and female author counts, ensuring more conservative results.", out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/female_authors.pdf")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:female-authors) highlights significant and consistent gender effects on the percentage of female authors over total authors cited in course readings while controlling for academic field and country in the regression.[^female-authors] Courses taught by a single male instructor consistently cite about 3% fewer female authors than those taught by a female instructor in the same cohort. However, the gap decreased by 25% between 2001 and 2019, going from 4% to 3%. Mixed-gender courses do not offset this disparity, as they cite fewer women by a similar margin, showing little difference from male-only classes taught by two instructors.  However, since 2013, a gap has emerged between mixed-gender and male-only courses, indicating a positive trend in gender representation driven by mixed-gender teams.

[^female-authors]: This analysis excludes syllabi where no readings were matched with the available bibliographic sources and, within the matched readings, excluding the references where the authors' gender remained unidentified.

## Age of Readings (“novelty”)

```{r age-readings, fig.cap = "The figure illustrates the evoloving differences in publication age of the readings selected in the courses. While male-only teams tend to select older readings than female-only ones, mixed-gender teams do not show a consistent pattern.", out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/age_readings.pdf")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:age-readings) illustrates significant gender differences in the publication age of the selected readings.[^age-footnote] Courses taught by a single male instructor between 2000 and 2019 tended to choose readings about 2% older than those taught by a single female instructor, indicating significant gender-based differences. Similarly, during the same period, courses taught by two male instructors tend to list older readings than female-only ones. No consistent differences emerge between same-gender and mixed-gender courses. These findings broadly support that as more women hold academic positions, the materials taught to students tend to be more current. At the same time, gender diversity appears to have little impact on the age of readings.

[^age-footnote]: This analysis includes only courses with matched bibliographic data. 

## Number of readings (“breadth”)

```{r uniq-docs, fig.cap = "The figure illustrates the evoloving differences in number of readings across different team types over time. It shows that while gender-based differences vary in magnitude, mixed-gender teaching teams consistently outperform same-gender teams in the number of readings, suggesting a key role of gender diversity in delivering more comprehensive courses.", out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/lg_uniq_docs.pdf")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:uniq-docs) illustrates the evolving differences in the number of readings across different team types, serving as a direct measure of a course's breadth. Courses taught by a single male instructor generally include more readings than those led by a single female instructor. However, the difference is greater between 2005 and 2015 and decreased to disappear in recent years. Mixed-gender courses exhibit significantly more readings than same-gender courses, though this difference varies over time, ranging from 20-30% between 2005 and 2015 to around 10% in recent years. In contrast, courses co-taught by two male instructors tend to list approximately 5% more readings than all-female ones throughout the period. While these findings highlight fluctuating gender-based differences in course breadth, they also indicate strongly that mixed-gender teaching teams are crucial in delivering more comprehensive courses or those with broader curricula. 

## Robustness

To ensure the reliability and robustness of our results, we conducted several additional analyses. We included random effects for institutions in our regressions to account for potential correlations at the institution level, thereby controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across institutions. We trimmed the dataset to exclude outliers. Specifically, we removed courses with an unusually high number of instructors or implausible reading data (e.g., courses with an unrealistically low age of readings or an excessive number of readings). This step showed that the regression results were not influenced by outliers. To address potential non-linear relationships between the predictors and outcomes, we tested several transformations of the dependent variables. This approach allowed us to verify whether our results hold under different assumptions about the functional form of the relationships. We further disaggregated the analysis by academic field and by country to examine the robustness of the results across various contexts. This allowed us to assess whether our findings were consistent across institutional and geographical settings. Overall, results appear robust to these additional analyses.
