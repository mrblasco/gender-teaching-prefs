Our analysis of approximately five million syllabi from over 4,000 universities revealed several key findings. Over the last twenty years, while the share of classes taught by female instructors has been increasing (individually and in teams), the fraction of mixed-gender co-teaching classes has remained unaltered. This trend can be explained by gender preferences in team formation, with a tendency of instructors to form teams with same-gender partners ("homophily"). We tested this hypothesis using Monte Carlo simulations and a well-established methodology. After comparing the observed teams against matches from gender-neutral simulations, we find that instructors tend to partner with same-gender colleagues more than twice as expected between 2005 and 2019. This result is robust to field, country, year, and institutional differences, which we account for in the simulations. Moreover, this pattern persists even when co-teaching teams are disaggregated by male-led and female-led groups, demonstrating that the trend holds for all genders regardless of hierarchical differences.

We argue that academic institutions are unlikely to explicitly forbid or discourage mixed-gender teams, so policies or administrative arrangements alone cannot explain these findings.^[However, policies aimed at preventing sexual harassment may unintentionally reduce incentives for cross-gender collaboration.] More likely, instructors have significant autonomy in forming co-teaching partnerships, and the observed gap in mixed-gender teams reflects strong gender-based homophily. At the same time, hierarchical differences or administrative arrangements can contribute to the observed gap in cross-gender collaborations, at least in part. Therefore, while our results hold across different institutions and regardless of whether men or women lead teams---suggesting hierarchy is not a primary factor---we cannot fully disentangle individual preferences from institutional preferences, requiring further research.

Our findings underscore the significant role of gender homophily in shaping co-teaching practices in academia, which may reinforce gender segregation in academia --- the so called "old boys club". This insight is crucial as it extends existing research on familiar drivers of gender bias in various settings within academia, especially research collaboration, access to funding, and student gender stereotypes. Here, we highlight the impact of teaching collaborations, which may limit the exchange of information among instructors and restrict students' access to diverse courses. This, in turn, could hinder interdisciplinary engagement or disproportionately disadvantage women in academic networks.


Our analysis of the association between gender composition and interdisciplinarity highlights a strong impact of gender diversity on interdisciplinary teaching. Between 2000 and 2019, mixed-gender teams are consistently more interdisciplinary than same-gender teams (male-only or female-only), highlighitng the importance of gender diversity for interdisciplinarity.  By contrast, women teaching alone are nearly as interdisciplinary as men. This highlights how gender preferences in team formation can impact teaching. By lowering the number of mixed-gender teams, gender preferences are also likely to reduce the amount of interdisciplinary course offerings. This finding adds a new potential barrier to the dissemination of interdisciplinary work in academia, which was overlooked previously.

Our analysis of gender composition and interdisciplinarity reveals a strong link between gender diversity and interdisciplinary teaching. Between 2000 and 2019, mixed-gender teams consistently exhibited greater interdisciplinarity than same-gender teams (male-only or female-only), underscoring the value of gender diversity in academia. Interestingly, women teaching alone are nearly as interdisciplinary as men, suggesting that gender preferences in team formation---not inherent differences in teaching styles---shape interdisciplinary outcomes. By reducing the prevalence of mixed-gender teams, these preferences likely limit interdisciplinary course offerings, introducing a previously overlooked barrier to the spread of interdisciplinary work in academia.

Another key finding relates to how gender composition shapes the representation of women authors in college education. We find that female-majority teams consistently cite more female authors than male-majority teams, holding this pattern across all team sizes. For instance, courses with a single male instructor cite about 10% fewer female authors than those taught by a female instructor. In mixed-gender teams, male-lead teams tend to cite considerably fewer women authors than female-lead ones. This evidence points to an adverse effect of mixed-gender collaboration on citing women’s materials for teaching. While this adverse effect is likely to impact female instructors, as their work is less visible among students, it may also affect students as they are exposed to less diverse work, which may impact their learning (e.g., through a lack of role models).

Finally, female instructors use more novel readings and materials in their syllabi when teaching alone than male instructors. Furthermore, all-female teams use more novel readings than women teaching alone. Additionally, on average, diverse teams of two instructors use readings older than those used by all-female teams but more recent than those used by all-male teams. This evidence suggests that women have a propensity for newer readings, which can benefit students who might be exposed to more content at the frontier. It is possible that, assuming women are younger on average, this gap in novelty could be driven by cohort effects. However, it is striking that the gap remains in diverse teams, suggesting a significant role in gender composition that goes beyond age.

This work is consistent with previous research showing an underrepresentation of gender-diverse teams in academia. However, contrary to research teams, we find that gender diversity harms women’s work citations and novelty, suggesting that women teaching alone or in teams of all women have more freedom in pursuing more novel materials and give credit to women authors. This points to potential difficulties in how instructors of different genders view teaching, which in turn may drive the matching of teams and ultimately affect students.   

However, instructors may not always be able to choose their team members. For example, instructors at higher levels of the hierarchy may have more weight in deciding who matches with whom. We try to consider this effect by examining the order of appearance in the syllabus as a proxy of instructors’ seniority. The analysis confirms strong gender preferences -- if the first instructor is a man, then 66% of the following instructors are men. Similarly, if the first instructor is a woman, 62% of the following instructors are women.  

This study provides critical insights into the market of academics. As for research teams, teaching teams can impact instructors in multiple ways. First, junior faculty may have access to experience and advice from senior faculty, which could lead to a higher chance of promotion. Secondly, diverse teaching teams may inspire research collaborations, including interdisciplinary work. Finally, teaching assistants can actively search for mentors and may benefit from these collaborations when they apply for PhD programs or in the labour market. Therefore, understanding how teaching teams are formed can help explain career trajectories.
