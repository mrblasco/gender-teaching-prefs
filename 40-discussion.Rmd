# Discussion

Our analysis of approximately five million syllabi from over 4,000 universities revealed several key findings. First, we show that, while the share of classes taught by female instructors has been increasing over the last twenty years, the fraction of mixed-gender co-teaching classes has remained consistently low (3%) and significantly below that of same-gender teams (10%). This trend can be explained by a limited gender diversity in certain fields or administrative practices that restrict opportunities to form mixed-gender collaborations. But it can also arise from gender preferences in team formation, whereby instructors tend to form teams with same-gender partners ("homophily"), a tendency already observed in research collaborations and other academic domains as discussed in the Introduction.

We further show that the underrepresentation of mixed gender teams persists even after accounting for unobserved differences across fields, institutions, and years. Specifically, we employ Monte Carlo simulations that randomly form teams in a gender-neutral manner, allowing us to control for important institutional constraints, such as maintaining constant the course loads across institutions and across 69 academic fields within a given year. By comparing simulated with actual teams, we  find that instructors tend to partner with same-gender colleagues more than twice as expected between 2005 and 2019. This result is robust across academic fields, although it is more pronounced in certain fields (Chemistry, Business, Medicine). Our findings also reveal that the underrepresention of mixed-gender teams is consistent across institutions in different countries, with the strongest effect in EU countries, where only 5% of courses are taught by mixed-gender teams, compared to an expected 12%.

Our findings further highlight how different team configurations are associated with key aspects of teaching: (1) mixed-gender teams tend to be more interdisciplinary than all-male teams, (2) all-female teams tend to assign more novel readings, and (3) mixed-gender teams tend to cite a higher share of female authors than all-male teams, but less than all-female teams. These associations are not driven by unobserved differences across fields, institutions, and years that we account for in the regressions. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms driving team formation in teaching.

Our analysis bears several limitations. First, the simulations could be improved by more granular information on the course's subfields that go beyond the 69 top-level fields identified in the dataset. If male and female instructors tend to concentrate in different subfields (e.g., Econometrics and Macroeconomics, within Economics), the observed underrepresentation of mixed-gender teams may reflect a limited availability of instructors of the other gender, especially for advanced courses where teaching teams are more likely to form around narrower areas of expertise. From a policy perspective, this limitation is important as we currently cannot disentangle whether the underrepresentation derives from gender-based preferences towards subfields, limiting availability, or a tendency to seek same-gender partners, homophily. Further research is needed to fully disentangle these underlying mechanisms.

Similarly, another limitation is the lack of data on potential determinants of team formation that operate within institutions, such as instructor experience or academic rank. Hierarchical differences or administrative structures may contribute to the observed gap in cross-gender collaborations — for example, if newly appointed female instructors are less likely to be selected by higher-ranking male instructors. However, our results illustrate that the under-representation of mixed-gender teams persists even when co-teaching teams are disaggregated by male-led and female-led courses (as measured by the oreder of appearance in the syllabus) demonstrating that the trend holds regardless of hierarchical differences. Therefore, while we cannot fully exclude other institutional constraints, the observed gap in mixed-gender teams likely reflects strong gender-based homophily.

Our findings underscore a significant and consistent underrepresentation of gender-mixed teaching teams, carrying serious implications. Limited mixed-gender collaborations in teaching may limit the exchange of information among instructors of different gender and restrict students' access to diverse courses. These dynamics, in turn, could hinder interdisciplinary engagement or reinforce structural disadvantages for women within academic networks. Our work thus identifies a potential additional driver of gender bias, complementing existing work on gender disparities in various settings within academia, such as research collaboration, access to funding, and student gender stereotypes.

<!-- TODO: review from HERE -->

<!-- Our analysis of gender composition and interdisciplinarity reveals a strong link between gender diversity and interdisciplinary teaching. Between 2000 and 2019, mixed-gender teams consistently exhibited greater interdisciplinarity than same-gender teams (male-only or female-only), underscoring the value of gender diversity in academia. Interestingly, women teaching alone are nearly as interdisciplinary as men, suggesting that gender preferences in team formation---not inherent differences in teaching styles---shape interdisciplinary outcomes. By reducing the prevalence of mixed-gender teams, these preferences likely limit interdisciplinary course offerings, introducing a previously overlooked barrier to the spread of interdisciplinary work in academia. -->

<!-- Another key finding relates to how gender composition shapes the representation of women authors in college education. We find that female-majority teams consistently cite more female authors than male-majority teams, holding this pattern across all team sizes. For instance, courses with a single male instructor cite about 10% fewer female authors than those taught by a female instructor. In mixed-gender teams, male-lead teams tend to cite considerably fewer women authors than female-lead ones. This evidence points to an adverse effect of mixed-gender collaboration on citing women’s materials for teaching. While this adverse effect is likely to impact female instructors, as their work is less visible among students, it may also affect students as they are exposed to less diverse work, which may impact their learning (e.g., through a lack of role models). -->

<!-- Finally, female instructors use more novel readings and materials in their syllabi when teaching alone than male instructors. Furthermore, all-female teams use more novel readings than women teaching alone. Additionally, on average, diverse teams of two instructors use readings older than those used by all-female teams but more recent than those used by all-male teams. This evidence suggests that women have a propensity for newer readings, which can benefit students who might be exposed to more content at the frontier. It is possible that, assuming women are younger on average, this gap in novelty could be driven by cohort effects. However, it is striking that the gap remains in diverse teams, suggesting a significant role in gender composition that goes beyond age. -->

<!-- Our work is consistent with previous research showing an underrepresentation of gender-diverse teams in academia. However, contrary to research teams, we find that gender diversity harms women's work citations and novelty, suggesting that women teaching alone or in teams of all women have more freedom in pursuing more novel materials and give credit to women authors. This points to potential difficulties in how instructors of different genders view teaching, which in turn may drive the matching of teams and ultimately affect students' outcomes.   -->

<!-- Instructors may not always be able to choose their team members. For example, instructors at higher levels of the hierarchy may have more weight in deciding who matches with whom. We try to consider this effect by examining the order of appearance in the syllabus as a proxy of instructors' seniority. The analysis confirms strong gender preferences -- if the first instructor is a man, then 66% of the following instructors are men. Similarly, if the first instructor is a woman, 62% of the following instructors are women.   -->

Overall, this study provides critical insights into the market of academics. As for research teams, teaching teams can impact instructors in multiple ways. First, junior faculty may have access to experience and advice from senior faculty, which could lead to a higher chance of promotion. Secondly, diverse teaching teams may inspire research collaborations, including interdisciplinary work. Finally, teaching assistants can actively search for mentors and may benefit from these collaborations when they apply for PhD programs or in the labour market. Therefore, understanding how teaching teams are formed can help explain career trajectories.
