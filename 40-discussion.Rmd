## Summary of the findings

Our analysis of approximately five million syllabi from over 4,000 universities in fifteen countries reveals several key findings. First, while the share of classes taught by female instructors has been increasing over the last twenty years, the fraction of mixed-gender co-teaching classes has remained consistently low (3%) and significantly below that of same-gender teams (10%). This trend can stem from a lack of gender diversity in specific fields or administrative practices that limit opportunities for forming mixed-gender collaborations. However, it can also arise from gender preferences in team formation, whereby instructors tend to form teams with same-gender partners ("homophily"), a tendency already observed in research collaborations and other academic domains [e.g., @kwiek2021gender].

Moreover, our analysis shows that the underrepresentation of mixed-gender teams persists even after accounting for unobserved differences across fields, institutions, and years. Specifically, employing Monte Carlo simulations that randomly form teams in a gender-neutral manner, our analysis controls for typical institutional constraints, such as maintaining constant course loads across institutions and 69 academic fields within a given year. By comparing simulated to actual teams, we find that instructors tend to partner with same-gender colleagues more than twice as expected between 2005 and 2019. This result is robust across academic fields, although it is more pronounced in specific fields (e.g., Chemistry, Business, Medicine). Additionally, the underrepresentation of mixed-gender teams is consistent across different countries, with the most substantial effect in EU countries, where only 5% of courses are taught by mixed-gender teams, compared to an expected 12%.

## Main Contributions 

These findings extend prior research on academic collaboration, which has traditionally focused on research partnerships [@boschini2007team;@wuchty2007increasing;@maddi2021gender;@guimera2005team;@yang2022gender], to the domain of teaching. The significant gender patterns and underrepresentation of mixed-gender co-teaching teams echo the literature on homophily and bias in team formation within research collaborations [e.g., @kwiek2021gender] and underscore the critical role of gender dynamics not only in scientific production but also in shaping pedagogical practices. Moreover, by combining the analysis of a massive syllabi dataset with Monte Carlo simulations of a gender-neutral team formation, our findings show that these patterns cannot be explained solely by country-level, institutional and field-specific factors, such as cultural barriers or a gender imbalance in specific fields. This evidence highlights the need to investigate these gender dynamics further, focusing on the underlying causal mechanisms that limit gender-diverse collaborations in teaching, a critical direction for future research.

Our analysis further highlights how different team configurations are associated with key aspects of teaching: (1) mixed-gender teams tend to be more interdisciplinary than all-male teams, (2) all-female teams tend to assign more novel readings, and (3) mixed-gender teams tend to cite a higher share of female authors than all-male teams, but less than all-female teams. These associations are not driven by unobserved differences across fields, institutions, and years that we account for in the regressions. Furthermore, these findings expand existing literature in the following ways.

First, building on prior research that measures interdisciplinary curricula [@evans2016measuring] and examines their effects on student outcomes [@han2023interdisciplinary], our study shifts the focus to the drivers of interdisciplinarity, linking it to the size and gender composition of teaching teams. While we find only minor and inconsistent gender differences in solo-taught teams, interdisciplinarity significantly increases in mixed-gender teaching teams. This effect is associated with the presence of women collaborators, who tend to be more interdisciplinary when working in teams. These findings extend the literature that compares interdisciplinarity between men and women in academic research [@pinheiro2022women] to the teaching domain, establishing a novel connection between gender diversity and interdisciplinary teaching practices. This connection highlights a potential lever for universities and academic institutions seeking to foster interdisciplinarity in their curricula.

Secondly, our study advances our understanding of the determinants of gender disparities in academic recognition [by extending the focus beyond scholarly citations to teaching materials. While prior research has extensively focused on gender citation gaps in academic publications [REFs], our findings illustrate the critical role of gender dynamics in the content presented in class and assigned readings. These findings suggest new potential drivers of gender stereotypes in academia [@chatterjee2021gender], underscoring the need to broaden research on the causal mechanisms underlying gender disparities in citation practices to include teaching contexts, thereby moving beyond the current emphasis on scholarly citations alone.

Finally, our findings reveal a persistent gender-based association with the assignment of novel materials, whereby female instructors tend to include more novel content in their syllabi than male instructors. This trend holds even when accounting for the order of appearance in the syllabus, which serves as a proxy for the instructional experience or hierarchical position. This evidence contributes to understanding the drivers of the observed gender-innovation gap in tertiary education [e.g.,@biasi2022education]. While our results suggest a strong gender association, they remain inconclusive regarding its underlying drivers, whether the pattern reflects gender per se or is confounded by age or career stage (e.g., younger vs. female instructors). Notably, this trend coincides with the growing presence of women entering academia during the study period, suggesting that newer instructors may play a key role in pushing curricular boundaries. Nonetheless, further research is needed to disentangle the influence of gender from other intersecting factors, such as cohort effects, field-specific norms, and institutional context.

## Limitations

Our analysis bears several limitations. First, we lack more granular information on the course's subfields that go beyond the 69 top-level fields identified in the dataset. If male and female instructors tend to concentrate on different subfields (e.g., Econometrics and Macroeconomics, within Economics), the observed underrepresentation of mixed-gender teams may reflect limited availability of instructors of the other gender in the subfield, especially for advanced courses where teaching teams are more likely to form around narrower areas of expertise. This limitation prevents disentangling the exact driver of mixed-gender underrepresentation, which can derive from gender-based preferences towards subfields, limiting availability, or a tendency to seek same-gender partners or homophily. Further research is needed to disentangle these underlying mechanisms fully.

Similarly, another limitation is the lack of data on potential determinants of team formation that operate within institutions, such as instructor experience or academic rank. Hierarchical differences or administrative structures may contribute to the observed gap in cross-gender collaborations â€” for example, if newly appointed female instructors are less likely to be selected by higher-ranking male instructors. However, our results illustrate that the under-representation of mixed-gender teams persists even when co-teaching teams are disaggregated by male-led and female-led courses (as measured by the order of appearance in the syllabus), demonstrating that the trend holds regardless of hierarchical differences. Therefore, while we cannot entirely exclude other institutional constraints, the observed gap in mixed-gender teams likely reflects strong gender-based homophily.

Our findings underscore a significant and consistent underrepresentation of gender-mixed teaching teams, carrying profound implications. Limited mixed-gender collaborations in teaching may limit the exchange of information among instructors of different genders and restrict students' access to diverse courses. These dynamics, in turn, could hinder interdisciplinary engagement or reinforce structural disadvantages for women within academic networks. Our work thus identifies a potential additional driver of gender bias, complementing existing research on gender disparities in various academic settings, including research collaboration, access to funding, and student gender stereotypes.

## Conclusion

Overall, this study offers critical insights into the academic market. As for research teams, teaching teams can impact instructors in multiple ways. First, junior faculty may have access to the experience and advice of senior faculty, which could increase their chances of promotion. Secondly, diverse teaching teams may inspire research collaborations, including interdisciplinary work. Finally, teaching assistants can actively seek out mentors and may benefit from these collaborations when applying for PhD programs or entering the labour market. Therefore, understanding how teaching teams are formed can help explain career trajectories.
