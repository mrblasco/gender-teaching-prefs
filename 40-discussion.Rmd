## Summary of the findings

Our analysis of approximately five million syllabi from over 4,000 universities in fifteen countries reveals several key findings. First, while the share of classes taught by female instructors has been increasing over the last twenty years, the fraction of mixed-gender co-teaching classes has remained consistently low (3%) and significantly below that of same-gender teams (10%). This trend can be explained by a limited gender diversity in certain fields or administrative practices that restrict opportunities to form mixed-gender collaborations. But it can also arise from gender preferences in team formation, whereby instructors tend to form teams with same-gender partners ("homophily"), a tendency already observed in research collaborations and other academic domains [e.g.,@kwiek2021gender].

Moreover, our analysis shows that the underrepresentation of mixed-gender teams persists even after accounting for unobserved differences across fields, institutions, and years. Specifically, employing Monte Carlo simulations that randomly form teams in a gender-neutral manner, our analysis controls for important institutional constraints, such as maintaining constant the course loads across institutions and across 69 academic fields within a given year. By comparing simulated with actual teams, we  find that instructors tend to partner with same-gender colleagues more than twice as expected between 2005 and 2019. This result is robust across academic fields, although it is more pronounced in certain fields (Chemistry, Business, Medicine). Additionally, the underrepresention of mixed-gender teams is consistent across different countries, with the strongest effect in EU countries, where only 5% of courses are taught by mixed-gender teams, compared to an expected 12%.

## Main Contributions 

These findings extend prior research on academic collaboration, traditionally centred on research partnerships [@boschini2007team;@wuchty2007increasing;@maddi2021gender;@guimera2005team;@yang2022gender], to the domain of teaching. The significant gender patterns and the underrepresentation of mixed-gender co-teaching teams echo the literature on homophily and bias in team formation within research collaboration [e.g.,@kwiek2021gender] and underscore the critical role of gender dynamics not only in scientific production but also in shaping pedagogical practices. Moreover, by combining the analysis of a massive syllabi dataset with Monte Carlo simulations of a gender-neutral team formation, our findings show that these patterns cannot be explained solely by country-level, institutional and field-specific factors, such as cultural barriers or a gender imbalance in certain fields. This evidence points to the need to investigate further these gender dynamics, focusing on the underlying causal mechanisms that limit gender-diverse collaborations in teaching, a critical direction for future research.

Our analysis further highlights how different team configurations are associated with key aspects of teaching: (1) mixed-gender teams tend to be more interdisciplinary than all-male teams, (2) all-female teams tend to assign more novel readings, and (3) mixed-gender teams tend to cite a higher share of female authors than all-male teams, but less than all-female teams. These associations are not driven by unobserved differences across fields, institutions, and years that we account for in the regressions. Furthermore, these findings expand existing literature on the following ways.

First, building on prior research that measures interdisciplinary curricula [@evans2016measuring] and examines their effects on student outcomes [@han2023interdisciplinary], our study shifts the focus to the drivers of interdisciplinarity, linking it to the size and gender composition of teaching teams. While we find only small and inconsistent gender differences in solo-taught teams, interdisciplinarity significantly increases in mixed-gender teaching teams. This effect is associated with the presence of women collaborators, who our findings suggest tend to be more interdisciplinary when working in teams. These findings extend the literature that compare interdisciplinarity between men and women in academic research [@pinheiro2022women] to the teaching domain, establishing a novel connection between gender diversity and interdisciplinary teaching practices. This connection highlights a potential lever for universities and academic institutions seeking to foster interdisciplinarity in their curricula.

Secondly, our study advances understanding of the determinants of gender disparities in academic recognition [by extending the focus beyond scholarly citations to teaching materials. While prior research has extensively focused on gender citation gaps in academic publications [REFs], our findings illustrate the critical role of gender dynamics in the content presented in class and assigned readings. These findings add new possible drivers of gender stereotypes in academia [@chatterjee2021gender], underscoring the need to broaden research on the causal mechanisms underlying gender disparities in citation practices to include teaching contexts, moving beyond the current emphasis on scholarly citations alone.

Finally, our findings reveal a persistent gender-based association with the assignment of novel materials, whereby female instructors tend to include more novel content in their syllabi than male instructors. This trend holds even when accounting for the order of appearance in the syllabus, which serves as a proxy for instructional experience or hierarchical position. This contributes to understanding the drivers of the observed gender-innovation gap in tertiary education [e.g.,@biasi2022education]. While our results point to a strong gender association, they remain inconclusive regarding its underlying drivers --- whether the pattern reflects gender per se or is confounded by age or career stage (e.g., younger vs. female instructors). Notably, this trend coincides with the growing presence of women entering academia during the study period, suggesting that newer instructors may play a key role in pushing curricular boundaries. Nonetheless, further research is needed to disentangle the influence of gender from other intersecting factors such as cohort effects, field-specific norms, and institutional context.

## Limitations

Our analysis bears several limitations. First, the simulations could be improved by more granular information on the course's subfields that go beyond the 69 top-level fields identified in the dataset. If male and female instructors tend to concentrate in different subfields (e.g., Econometrics and Macroeconomics, within Economics), the observed underrepresentation of mixed-gender teams may reflect a limited availability of instructors of the other gender, especially for advanced courses where teaching teams are more likely to form around narrower areas of expertise. From a policy perspective, this limitation is important as we currently cannot disentangle whether the underrepresentation derives from gender-based preferences towards subfields, limiting availability, or a tendency to seek same-gender partners, homophily. Further research is needed to fully disentangle these underlying mechanisms.

Similarly, another limitation is the lack of data on potential determinants of team formation that operate within institutions, such as instructor experience or academic rank. Hierarchical differences or administrative structures may contribute to the observed gap in cross-gender collaborations — for example, if newly appointed female instructors are less likely to be selected by higher-ranking male instructors. However, our results illustrate that the under-representation of mixed-gender teams persists even when co-teaching teams are disaggregated by male-led and female-led courses (as measured by the oreder of appearance in the syllabus) demonstrating that the trend holds regardless of hierarchical differences. Therefore, while we cannot fully exclude other institutional constraints, the observed gap in mixed-gender teams likely reflects strong gender-based homophily.

Our findings underscore a significant and consistent underrepresentation of gender-mixed teaching teams, carrying serious implications. Limited mixed-gender collaborations in teaching may limit the exchange of information among instructors of different gender and restrict students' access to diverse courses. These dynamics, in turn, could hinder interdisciplinary engagement or reinforce structural disadvantages for women within academic networks. Our work thus identifies a potential additional driver of gender bias, complementing existing work on gender disparities in various settings within academia, such as research collaboration, access to funding, and student gender stereotypes.

<!-- Our analysis of gender composition and interdisciplinarity reveals a strong link between gender diversity and interdisciplinary teaching. Between 2000 and 2019, mixed-gender teams consistently exhibited greater interdisciplinarity than same-gender teams (male-only or female-only), underscoring the value of gender diversity in academia. Interestingly, women teaching alone are nearly as interdisciplinary as men, suggesting that gender preferences in team formation---not inherent differences in teaching styles---shape interdisciplinary outcomes. By reducing the prevalence of mixed-gender teams, these preferences likely limit interdisciplinary course offerings, introducing a previously overlooked barrier to the spread of interdisciplinary work in academia. -->

<!-- Another key finding relates to how gender composition shapes the representation of women authors in college education. We find that female-majority teams consistently cite more female authors than male-majority teams, holding this pattern across all team sizes. For instance, courses with a single male instructor cite about 10% fewer female authors than those taught by a female instructor. In mixed-gender teams, male-lead teams tend to cite considerably fewer women authors than female-lead ones. This evidence points to an adverse effect of mixed-gender collaboration on citing women’s materials for teaching. While this adverse effect is likely to impact female instructors, as their work is less visible among students, it may also affect students as they are exposed to less diverse work, which may impact their learning (e.g., through a lack of role models). -->

<!-- Finally, female instructors use more novel readings and materials in their syllabi when teaching alone than male instructors. Furthermore, all-female teams use more novel readings than women teaching alone. Additionally, on average, diverse teams of two instructors use readings older than those used by all-female teams but more recent than those used by all-male teams. This evidence suggests that women have a propensity for newer readings, which can benefit students who might be exposed to more content at the frontier. It is possible that, assuming women are younger on average, this gap in novelty could be driven by cohort effects. However, it is striking that the gap remains in diverse teams, suggesting a significant role in gender composition that goes beyond age. -->

<!-- Our work is consistent with previous research showing an underrepresentation of gender-diverse teams in academia. However, contrary to research teams, we find that gender diversity harms women's work citations and novelty, suggesting that women teaching alone or in teams of all women have more freedom in pursuing more novel materials and give credit to women authors. This points to potential difficulties in how instructors of different genders view teaching, which in turn may drive the matching of teams and ultimately affect students' outcomes.   -->

<!-- Instructors may not always be able to choose their team members. For example, instructors at higher levels of the hierarchy may have more weight in deciding who matches with whom. We try to consider this effect by examining the order of appearance in the syllabus as a proxy of instructors' seniority. The analysis confirms strong gender preferences -- if the first instructor is a man, then 66% of the following instructors are men. Similarly, if the first instructor is a woman, 62% of the following instructors are women.   -->

## Conclusion

Overall, this study provides critical insights into the market of academics. As for research teams, teaching teams can impact instructors in multiple ways. First, junior faculty may have access to experience and advice from senior faculty, which could lead to a higher chance of promotion. Secondly, diverse teaching teams may inspire research collaborations, including interdisciplinary work. Finally, teaching assistants can actively search for mentors and may benefit from these collaborations when they apply for PhD programs or in the labour market. Therefore, understanding how teaching teams are formed can help explain career trajectories.
