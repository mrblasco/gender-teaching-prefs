# Introduction

Universities, vocational schools, and other higher-education institutions are crucial in disseminating knowledge and developing human capital. Instructors shape this role through their choices in teaching subjects, assigned readings, and co-teaching arrangements. These decisions have a significant impact on student learning outcomes and students' career trajectories [@bakkenes2010teacher;@vembye2024effects;@han2023interdisciplinary]. However, they are not always optimal. Instructors can prefer working alone or with colleagues from similar backgrounds, limiting course diversity and interdisciplinarity, reinforcing gender stereotypes on certain subjects  [@ellemers2018gender;@lockwood2006someone;@canaan2023impact], or even limiting instructors' exposure to different teaching methodologies, hindering their professional growth [@buckingham2021learning]. Despite its significance, however, research on the underlying factors driving instructors' choices in teaching remains limited mostly due to a lack of data.

While prior research has examined academics' decision-making in research collaborations, less is known about how these decisions shape teaching practices and, in turn, student outcomes. This study contributes to this literature by analysing a massive dataset of English course syllabi taught between 1990 and 2019 across several countries. This dataset allows for a systematic, quantitive analysis of teaching treands over multiple years [@nowogrodzki2016mining].

Each syllabus provides detailed information about the instructors, including their gender, the institution, and the course's content, including its field, assigned readings, and an overall description of its content. This data allows us to systematically examine how instructors of different genders form teams, shedding light on gender preferences and institutional constraints in teaching collaboration. Additionally, by computing various metrics related to teaching content, this data let us assess how different configurations of the teaching teams --- gender composition and size --- associate with teaching practices, particularly interdisciplinarity and the assigned readings, controlling for institution, field, academic year, and other potential drivers of content.

<!-- While prior research has investigated the role of gender [@milojevic2014principles;@boschini2007team;@love2022impact], less attention has been devoted to study the impact of these preferences on teaching collaborations and the impact on students.  -->

Specifically, we aim to address two key questions. First, how often do academics choose to teach alone versus co-teach with a colleague, and to what extent are co-teaching teams composed of mixed-gender pairs? Second, how do the size and gender composition of teaching teams relates with key aspects of teaching: (1) the course's interdisciplinarity, (2) the novelty of assigned readings, and (3) the gender representation of the cited authors. Previous research has shown that these aspects shape students' learning outcomes and career trajectories [@bakkenes2010teacher;@vembye2024effects;@han2023interdisciplinary], while also influencing instructors' professional development and promotion within their institution [@buckingham2021learning].

Our results reveal a significant role for gender in co-teaching practices, with mixed-gender teams occurring consistently less frequently than same-gender teams across institutions and fields. Furthermore, mixed-gender teams occurr much less frequently than expected under a null model that forms teams in a gender-neutral manner, while keeping the field and institutional constraints fixed. These findings underscore a consistent and widespread underrepresentation of mixed-gender collaborations in teaching, that is not fully explained by unobserved differences across fields or institutions. 

Our analysis further reveals a significant and strong association between the gender composition of a teaching team and the course's interdisciplinarity, with mixed-gender teams being more interdisciplinary than all-male teams or courses taught by individual instructors. We also find a significant association of team configurations with the fraction of cited female authors, with courses taught by a female instructor alone citing a higher fraction of female authors compared to courses taught by male instructors, with mixed-gender teams falling in between. Finally, we also find a trend in novelty, with female instructors assigning more recent readings compared to men regardless of team size. 

Previous research has shown that interdisciplinarity research is less likely to be funded [@bromham2016interdisciplinary], tends to attract fewer citations when it is highly interdisciplinary [@lariviere2010relationship], and is correlated with the probability of publication in academic journals [@xiang2025evaluating]. Furthermore, students attending colleges with more interdisciplinary courses tend to earn higher earnings after graduation [@evans2016measuring;@han2023interdisciplinary]. We extend this work by looking at the association between gender composition and interdisciplniarity in teaching teaching, showing how mixed-gender teams occur less frequently but tend to be more interdisciplinary, suggesting that removing barriers to mixed-gender team formation may increase interdisciplinarity in teaching.

Our findings also contribute to the literature on gender dynamics in academia, particularly research team formation [@milojevic2014principles;@boschini2007team;@love2022impact], which has shown significant gender homophily -- a tendency to collaborate with colleagues of the same gender [@kwiek2021gender]. It also examines gender differences in citation patterns, a driving factor of the persistent gender bias in academia [@boivin2024sexism], including tenure promotion [@weisshaar2017publish], grant success [@bedi2012gender], co-authorships [@boschini2007team], and peer recognition [@sarsons2017recognition;@card2022gender]. While prior research has largely focused on these areas, we shift attention to the citation gap in teaching. This issue may not only reinforce existing gender bias in academia but also shape students' learning outcomes and future career choices [@card2022impact] -- effects that are less well understood.

We also build on prior research on the underrepresentation of female-authored works in university curricula, which has been shown within specific fields (psychology and international relations) and at a small scale [@skitka2021gender;@colgan2017gender;@harris2020diversify]. Our results reveal a consistent and significant gap in cited works between female and male instructors, that is only partially addressed within mixed-gender co-teaching. 

Finally, studies about team formation are especially relevant to our work. These studies have found a tendency of mixed-gender teams to perform better in various settings  [@yang2022gender;@bear2011role]. In research collaboration, for example, mixed-gender teams often obtain more citations, produce more novel research, publish in more prestigious journals and are more interdisciplinary [@maddi2021gender;@yang2022gender]. Although we do not measure team "performance" as we lack data on students outcomes, our results show that mixed-gender co-teaching teams are consistently less likely to form, but once created, they tend to deliver different outcomes, especially a higher interdisciplinarity, that previous literature has suggested having an impact on students outcomes as discussed above.
