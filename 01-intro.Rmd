# Introduction

Universities, vocational schools, and other higher-education institutions are crucial in disseminating knowledge and developing human capital. Instructors shape this role through their choices in teaching subjects, reading selections, and co-teaching arrangements. These decisions have a significant impact on student learning outcomes [@bakkenes2010teacher;@vembye2024effects]. However, they are not always optimal. Instructors can prefer working alone or with colleagues from similar backgrounds, limiting course diversity and interdisciplinarity, reinforcing gender stereotypes on certain subjects  [@ellemers2018gender;@lockwood2006someone;@canaan2023impact], or even limiting instructors' exposure to different teaching methodologies, hindering their professional growth [@buckingham2021learning]. Despite its significance, however, research on the underlying factors driving instructors' choices in teaching remains limited mostly due to a lack of data.

While prior research has examined academics' decision-making in research collaborations, less is known about how these decisions shape teaching practices and, in turn, student outcomes. This study addresses this gap by analysing a massive dataset of English course syllabi taught between 1990 and 2019 across several countries. This dataset allows for a systematic, quantitive analysis of teaching treands over multiple years [@nowogrodzki2016mining]. 

Each syllabus provides detailed information about the instructor's gender and institution, as well as the course content, including its academic field, assigned readings, and overall description. This data allows us to systematically examine how instructors of different genders form teams, shedding light on gender preferences in collaboration. Additionally, it enables us to compute various metrics related to teaching content, assessing how these teaching teams shape teaching practices, particularly interdisciplinarity and the readings selections.

<!-- While prior research has investigated the role of gender [@milojevic2014principles;@boschini2007team;@love2022impact], less attention has been devoted to study the impact of these preferences on teaching collaborations and the impact on students.  -->

We analyse the data to address two key questions. First, how often academics decide to teach alone or co-teach with someone, and how do gender preferences influence co-teaching practices? Second, how do the size and gender composition of teaching teams affect teaching, especially the course's interdisciplinarity and the readings selections. More specifically, we examine three key areas that impact students: the number of readings, which reflects the breadth of the curriculum; the publication age of the readings, indicating the recency and relevance of the material; and the gender representation of the cited authors. 

Our results show a significant role for gender preferences in co-teaching practices, with the number of mixed-gender teams considerably lower than expected by a null model without gender preferences. We also document a strong association between gender composition and interdisciplinarity, novelty, and the representation of female authors, suggesting that the team formation process strongly influences content and student outcomes. 

We contribute to the existing literature on interdisciplinarity in academia [@evans2016measuring;@han2023interdisciplinary]. While previous research has shown that interdisciplinary research is less likely to be funded, cited, and published in high-impact journals [@lariviere2010relationship;@bromham2016interdisciplinary], we extend this work to teaching, showing the role played by co-teaching practices, with interdisciplinary courses being more likely to be taught by mixed-gender teams, and gender preferences limiting the formation of such teams.

Our findings also contribute to the literature on gender dynamics in academia, particularly research team formation [@milojevic2014principles;@boschini2007team;@love2022impact], which has shown significant gender homophily -- a tendency to collaborate with colleagues of the same gender [@kwiek2021gender]. It also examines gender differences in citation patterns, a driving factor of the persistent gender bias in academia [@boivin2024sexism], including tenure promotion [@weisshaar2017publish], grant success [@bedi2012gender], co-authorships [@boschini2007team], and peer recognition [@sarsons2017recognition;@card2022gender]. While prior research has largely focused on these areas, we shift attention to the citation gap in teaching. This issue may not only reinforce existing gender bias in academia but also shape students' learning outcomes and future career choices [@card2022impact] -- effects that are less well understood.

We also extend prior research on the gender gap in female-authored works, which has been examined on a small scale within specific fields. For example, a study found fewer female-authored papers in social/personality psychology courses [@skitka2021gender], while another study showed that female instructors were more likely to assign such papers in international relations [@colgan2017gender], and women authors are generally underrepresented in college readings [@harris2020diversify].

Finally, studies about team formation are especially relevant to our work. These studies have found a tendency of mixed-gender teams to perform better in various settings  [@yang2022gender;@bear2011role]. In research collaboration, for example, mixed-gender teams often obtain more citations, produce more novel research, publish in more prestigious journals and are more interdisciplinary [@maddi2021gender;@yang2022gender]. This study extends the issue to teaching practices, showing that mixed-gender co-teaching teams are more likely to teach interdisciplinary courses, assign more novel readings, and cite more female authors.
