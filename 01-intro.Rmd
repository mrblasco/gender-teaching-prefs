# Introduction

Universities and other higher education institutions play a crucial role in disseminating knowledge and developing human capital. Central to this mission are instructors, whose choices regarding course content, assigned readings, and collaboration with colleagues directly shape the educational experience. These decisions have a significant impact on students' learning outcomes and their career trajectories [@bakkenes2010teacher;@vembye2024effects;@han2023interdisciplinary]. However, such choices do not always align with what is best for students. Instructors may prefer working alone or with colleagues from similar backgrounds, which can limit course diversity and interdisciplinarity, reinforce gender stereotypes in specific subjects [@ellemers2018gender;@lockwood2006someone;@canaan2023impact], or even restrict instructors' exposure to different teaching methodologies, hindering their professional growth [@buckingham2021learning]. Despite its significance, research on the underlying factors that drive these teaching choices remains limited, primarily due to a lack of data.

This study addresses this gap by analysing a large dataset of English course syllabi from 1990 to 2019 across fifteen countries, which has been previously used to study school curricula [@han2023interdisciplinary], teaching metrics [@nowogrodzki2016mining], the impacts of AI [@gao2023quantifying], and the education-innovation gap [@biasi2022education]. The dataset enables a systematic, quantitative analysis of long-term trends. Each syllabus includes instructor gender, institutional affiliation, course field, assigned readings, and a course description. This allows us to examine gender-based team formation, revealing potential preferences and institutional constraints in teaching collaborations. Furthermore, we analyse how team composition, particularly gender and size, relates to teaching practices, such as interdisciplinarity and reading assignments, while controlling for institutional factors, field, academic year, and other relevant variables.

Specifically, this study addresses two key questions. First, how often do academics choose to teach alone versus co-teach with a colleague, and to what extent are co-teaching teams composed of mixed-gender pairs? Second, how do the size and gender composition of teaching teams relate to key aspects of teaching: (1) the course's interdisciplinarity, (2) the novelty of assigned readings, and (3) the gender representation of the cited authors? Previous research has shown that these aspects shape students' learning outcomes and career trajectories [@bakkenes2010teacher; @vembye2024effects; @han2023interdisciplinary] while also influencing instructors' professional development and promotion within their institutions [@buckingham2021learning].

Our results reveal a significant role for gender in co-teaching practices, with mixed-gender teams occurring consistently less frequently than same-gender teams across institutions and fields. Furthermore, mixed-gender teams arise much less often than expected under a null model that forms teams in a gender-neutral manner while keeping fixed field-related and institutional constraints. These findings underscore a persistent and widespread underrepresentation of mixed-gender collaborations in teaching, that is not fully explained by unobserved differences across fields or institutions. 

Our analysis further reveals a significant and strong association between the gender composition of a teaching team and the course's interdisciplinarity, with mixed-gender teams being more interdisciplinary than all-male teams or courses taught by individual instructors. This evidence suggests that gender diversity can be a potential lever for increasing interdisciplinary teaching in tertiary education. We also find a significant association between team configurations and the fraction of cited female authors. Specifically, classes taught by a female instructor alone tend to cite a higher fraction of female authors compared to courses taught by male instructors, with mixed-gender teams falling in between. This highlights teaching practices as an understudied potential driver of the underrepresentation of women in academia. Finally, we also observe a trend in novelty, with female instructors assigning more recent readings than their male counterparts, regardless of team size. This evidence contributes to the debate on the factors shaping the education-innovation gap [@biasi2022education].

While prior research has investigated academics decision-making, especially how they form research collaborations [@guimera2005team;@wuchty2007increasing;@milojevic2014principles;@yang2022gender], less is known about their teaching choices, including the formation of co-teaching teams, interdisciplinarity, and reading selections, and their effects on student outcomes.

Our findings contribute to the literature on gender dynamics in academia, particularly research team formation [@milojevic2014principles;@boschini2007team;@love2022impact], which has shown significant gender homophily --- a tendency to collaborate with colleagues of the same gender [@kwiek2021gender]. It also examines gender differences in citation patterns, a driving factor of the persistent gender bias in academia [@boivin2024sexism], including tenure promotion [@weisshaar2017publish], grant success [@bedi2012gender], co-authorships [@boschini2007team], and peer recognition [@sarsons2017recognition;@card2022gender]. While prior research has primarily focused on these areas, we shift our attention to the citation gap in teaching. This issue may not only reinforce existing gender bias in academia but also shape students' learning outcomes and future career choices [@card2022impact], effects that are less well understood.

By focusing on the relationships between teaching and interdisciplinarity, our work also contributes to the literature on the factors influencing interdisciplinarity in academia. There is evidence that interdisciplinarity research is less likely to be funded [@bromham2016interdisciplinary], tends to attract fewer citations when it is highly interdisciplinary [@lariviere2010relationship], and is correlated with the probability of publication in academic journals [@xiang2025evaluating]. Furthermore, students attending colleges with more interdisciplinary courses tend to earn higher earnings after graduation [@evans2016measuring;@han2023interdisciplinary]. We extend this work by examining the association between gender composition and interdisciplinarity in teaching, showing that mixed-gender teams occur less frequently but tend to be more interdisciplinary. This finding suggests that removing barriers to mixed-gender team formation may increase interdisciplinarity in teaching.


We also build on prior research on the underrepresentation of female-authored works in university curricula, which has been shown within specific fields (psychology and international relations) and at a small scale [@skitka2021gender;@colgan2017gender;@harris2020diversify]. Our results reveal a consistent and significant gap in the number of cited works between female and male instructors, which is only partially addressed within mixed-gender co-teaching. This evidence highlights teaching practices as an important factor shaping gender differences in recognition among scholars.

Finally, studies about team formation are especially relevant to our work. These studies have found that mixed-gender teams tend to perform better in various settings [@yang2022gender;@bear2011role]. In research collaboration, for example, mixed-gender teams often obtain more citations, produce more novel research, publish in more prestigious journals, and are more interdisciplinary [@maddi2021gender; @yang2022gender]. Although we do not measure team "performance" as we lack data on students outcomes, our results show that mixed-gender co-teaching teams are consistently less likely to form, but, once created, they tend to deliver different outcomes, especially a higher interdisciplinarity, that previous literature has suggested having an impact on students outcomes as discussed above.
